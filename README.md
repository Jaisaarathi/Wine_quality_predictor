# Wine_quality_predictor


Run Flask App:

Ensure your Flask app is running. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing your app.py file.
You should see output indicating that the Flask app is running.

Access the App:

Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the address shown in your terminal where Flask is running).


Interact with the Form:

You should see the form for predicting wine quality.
Enter values into the form fields and click the "Predict" button.

Check the Styling:

The styling changes from the CSS file should be applied to the form elements, providing a more attractive appearance.
Remember that these changes won't be visible in the code snippet here. To see the actual styling, you need to run the Flask app locally on your machine and access it through a web browser. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!
